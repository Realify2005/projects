# Projects written in C

foa-1 is a project that lets user perform arithmetics of up to 500 digits using arrays, since C has a maximum integer of 2147483647 (32-bit) by default

foa-2 is a project that returns an output based on user text inputs, similar to an autocomplete algorithm

Overall, foa-2 was 10x harder (and longer) to develop than foa-1
